## Lyrics

```
i can see the signs
- forming all around
i've been seering thru the skies
i've been facing wrath of gods___ (long end)

make up your mind, brethren be damned
make up your mind, traces all around
what you gonna find

SO IT'S ALL FORGIVEN (NEVER) COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS 
SEE I (NEVER?) FELT THE VERTIGO(S) (SO) PRESSING ON MY MERIT
YOU JUST BETTER NEED TO HEED THE OMENS (BLOOD) 
SEER HAD A VISION BUT HE NEVER SEES IT ALL

 VEER INTO COLLISIONS - WIND IN MY EYES

 YOUR SO IT'S HAD A FOR BUT

rest in fervent fever till I take my curses back
in your life's name every day I'm nearer to the drop of blood on the wall
only thing i say is shame

i can cast a spell of repetition 



before i made (it to) the top
made my own demise
along gone paths
keen on tricking ya all 

is this true,
been facing wrath of gods alone

they told me it's enough
wanna drop it but I know i can't stop it

i been tellin on ya all

```
