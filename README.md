## Lyrics

```
i can see the signs
- forming all around
i've been seering thru the skies
i've been facing wrath of gods___ (long end)

all's forgiven count your blessings
rest in fervent fever 
i cast a spell 
till I take it back

before i made (it to) the top
made my own demise
along gone paths
keen on tricking ya all 

is this true,
been facing wrath of gods alone

they told me it's enough
wanna drop it but I know i can't stop it

i been tellin on ya all

```
