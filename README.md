## Lyrics

```
i can see the signs forming all around           
i've been seering through the skies
i've been facing wrath of gods

i can see the signs forming all around           
i've been seering through the skies
i've been facing wrath of gods

gods

i can see the signs forming all around           
i've been seering through the skies
i've been facing wrath of gods

make up your mind, brethren be damned
make up your mind, traces all around

so it's all forgiven never count your blessings
see I never felt the vertigos so pressing on my merit
you just better need to heed the omens blood
seer had a vision but he never sees it all

hate is the only thing running in my veins    
i'm a sick fuck just another product of pain

all of my disciples are rebels they just wanna kill
murder on my fingertips a source of my adrenaline 

all of these perpetrators that you wanna protect 
they feed onto your soul and lead into your death

bloodied up, bloodied up
bloodied up, bloodied up

```

## Notes

A viceral, emotionally occult track from Grit Gods duo consisting of Killlxv and MOTHNODE has found its way into the void. Conjoined deathcore influences and heavy bass might break through the veil, tread carefully on full volume. Sometimes though, it is better to break through the illusion and describe the actual truth. The titular residue represents the torn connection between humans in our modern age and resulting cult-like approach to grasping for it at every possibility.

/// old_
Gospel of hate, . It is the issue of residue being the only thing remaining that can bring us back to love of the world but it is really pointless to look for it. Flesh vs soul discrepancy.
