## Lyrics

```
I can see the signs forming all around                   /// MOTHNODE
I've been seering thru the skies
I've been facing wrath of gods

Make up your mind, brethren be damned
Make up your mind, traces all around

So it's all forgiven never count your blessings
See I never felt the vertigos so pressing on my merit
You just better need to heed the omens blood
Seer had a vision but he never sees it all

Hate is the only thing running in my veins               /// KILLLXV
I'm a sick fuck just another product of pain

All of my disciples are rebels they just wanna kill
Murder on my fingertips a source of my adrenaline 

All of these perpetrators that you wanna protect 
They feeding on your soul and leading to your death

Bloodied up bloodied up
Bloodied up bloodied up

Make up your mind, brethren be damned                   /// MOTHNODE + KILLXV
Make up your mind, traces all around

I can see the signs forming all around                   /// MOTHNODE + KILLXV
I've been seering thru the skies
I've been facing wrath of gods

----------------------------------------------

MISC VERSES

VEER INTO COLLISIONS - WIND IN MY EYES
YOUR SO IT'S HAD A FOR BUT

rest in fervent fever till I take my curses back
in your life's name every day I'm nearer to the drop of blood on the wall
only thing i say is shame

i can cast a spell of repetition 
before i made (it to) the top
made my own demise
along gone paths
fate is like that
keen on tricking ya all 

is this true,
been facing wrath of gods alone
they told me it's enough
wanna drop it but I know i can't stop it
i been tellin on ya all

```

## Notes

Gospel of hate, the RESIDUE of torn connection with humans. It is the issue of residue being the only thing remaining that can bring us back to love of the world but it is really pointless to look for it.
